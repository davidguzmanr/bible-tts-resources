# bible-tts-resources
The whole list with available languages is in [Bible audio resources clean](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1P4xk-MgjP7nxWTuo8-pTmVTeICUw1dQOT7GXmjgjsSc/edit?usp=sharing).

## Notes
- Chhattisgarhi, there were multiple audio formats, I kept the one that followed the same naming convention as the others.
- Toma language transcripts follow their own format, maybe skip it.
